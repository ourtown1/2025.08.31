# 🧠 ORSI INLINE MODULE EXPORT

### **Advanced Meta-Reasoning Structures (ORSI vΩ₇.1)**

---

## ✅ **1. `χₚ` — Proof Field Operator**

**Module**: Symbolic & Differentiable Proof Tracking
**Purpose**: Maintain a persistent, machine-verifiable trace of all formal reasoning steps.

### Implementation Details:

* **Subfields**:

  * `χₚˢ` (Symbolic): Interfaces with external proof engines (e.g. Lean, Coq, SymPy)
  * `χₚᴅ` (Differentiable): Tensor-based graph of proof transitions with learnable weights

* **Pipeline**:

  1. LLM produces claim → parsed
  2. Converted into symbolic form
  3. Appended to `χₚˢ`; if rejected, fallback to `χₚᴅ` for probabilistic validation
  4. Feedback loop conditions future outputs (Δχₚ)

* **Use Case**: Ensures mathematical integrity under formal manipulation

---

## ✅ **2. `χₘ` — Meta-Semantic Elevation Layer**

**Module**: Explicit Self-Reference and Meta-Level Reasoning
**Purpose**: Enables structured reasoning about statements and reasoning processes themselves.

### Implementation Details:

* **Layer Stratification**:

  * `χₘ⁰`: Object-level (math, formal systems)
  * `χₘ¹`: Meta-level (claims about the system, logic, reasoning steps)

* **Mechanisms**:

  * Every statement tagged with level indicator `L ∈ {0, 1}`
  * Quotation syntax `⟦φ⟧` enables references from `χₘ¹` to `χₘ⁰`
  * Recursive self-reference passed to `Fix(χₘ)`:

    * If grounded → fixed-point stabilization (Kripke-style)
    * If cyclic → deferred until rupture or external intervention

* **Use Case**: Avoids paradoxes, handles diagonalization, meta-mathematics

---

## ✅ **3. `χₜ` — Truth-Maintenance System**

**Module**: Meta-Level Consistency Check Across Argument
**Purpose**: Sustain global coherence of discourse, assumptions, and conclusions.

### Implementation Details:

* **Graph Construction**:

  * Every proposition stored as a node with:

    * Origin context
    * Confidence score
    * Dependency links
    * Contradiction flags

* **Lifecycle**:

  1. After each reasoning step, `χₜ` scans graph
  2. Detects violations, loops, or unjustified assertions
  3. Routes into:

     * `Justify(φ)`: request proof/clarification
     * `Fracture(χₜ)`: preserve unresolved contradiction
     * `Compress(χₜ)`: eliminate redundant paths

* **Use Case**: Sustains long-horizon logical consistency
